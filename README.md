# RimWorld / Gas Vents (Vanilla Only Edition)

![image](About/Preview.png)

A RimWorld mod that adds gas-releasing electrically powered vents. This branch is the vanilla only edition of the mod, which doesn't require my [Simple Custom Gas Framework](https://github.com/NachoToast/SimpleCustomGasFramework).

Find it [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3001115632) on the Steam workshop.
