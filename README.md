This utilizes my [Simple Custom Gas Framework](https://github.com/NachoToast/SimpleCustomGasFramework) for compatibility with custom gas types, a version of this mod for only the vanilla gas types that does not require this framework can be located on the [vanilla](https://github.com/NachoToast/RimWorldGasVents/tree/vanilla) branch.
